👋🏿 hi! my name is mara and i'm a freshman at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

🦉 i am majoring in Computer Science + Data Science :)

    📜 why did I choose both? Initially i chose to major in computer science because I want to challenge myself and pursue a career that would allow me to be a life long learner. i added DS to get variety in my skill set ;)

🧠 current courses: CSCI 1133, Introduction to Programming Concepts, with python
🌱 working on creating some projects and developing my skills!
